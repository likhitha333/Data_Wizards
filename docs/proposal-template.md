# Introduction

The project's goal is to develop a cutting-edge smartphone software that assists users in staying hydrated. Users may establish customizable goals for water intake, measure their daily water consumption, and receive frequent push reminders throughout the day thanks to an easy-to-use UI. The software will give users a comprehensive picture of their hydration patterns by effortlessly integrating with well-known health-tracking programs and smartwatches.

The software will track its users' patterns of hydration and offer tailored recommendations to encourage regular water consumption through data analytics. Users' general well-being will be enhanced by these tailored comments, which will encourage them to lead better lifestyles and drink enough of water.

# Anticipated Technologies

1. **HTML, CSS, JS**: For developing the front-end of the app (if a web-based interface is involved).
2. **Python**: For managing back-end functionality, such as data processing and notification logic.
3. **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration during the development process.
4. **MongoDB**: To store user data, including hydration goals and intake logs.

# Method/Approach

1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - Setting the key features of the app, such as water intake tracking, goal setting, and push notifications.
   - Conduct research to understand user preferences for hydration reminders.

2. **Front-End Development**:
   - Design a easy-to-use interface where users can log their water intake and view their progress.
   - Implement this interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if a web component is involved.

3. **Back-End Development**:
   - Use Python or Java to handle core functionalities, such as recording water intake, setting reminder schedules.
   - Create a database schema in MongoDB to store user information, hydration logs, and preferences.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Thoroughly test the app on different devices to ensure reliable performance, timely reminders, and proper storage of user data.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a public platform, such as a mobile app store or a web hosting service.

# Estimated Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Research and design, including defining requirements and creating wireframes for the user interface.
2. **Week 3-4**: Front-end development, creating the main UI and linking it with core functionalities.
3. **Week 5-6**: Back-end development, including setting up user authentication, water intake tracking, and notifications.
4. **Week 6-7**: Testing and debugging the app to ensure a smooth user experience.
5. **Week 7-8**: Deploying the app and gathering initial user feedback.

# Anticipated Problems

1. **Notification System**: Ensuring that the reminder notifications are timely and donâ€™t overwhelm users.
2. **User Data Security**: Ensuring the security of user data, particularly personal health information stored in the database.

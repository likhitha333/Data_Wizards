# Water Hydration Tracker
The objective of the project is to create a modern day smartphone software that motivates users to keep themselves hydrated by reminding them to drink water more often throughout the day. Through a simple UI, users can quickly track their daily water usage, establish configurable goals for their intake, and receive push reminders at certain intervals. The app will also work well with well-known health-tracking applications and smartwatches, giving users a complete picture of their hydration patterns. By utilizing data analytics, the app will track patterns in users' hydration habits and provide tailored recommendations to promote increased water consumption and, eventually, a healthier way of living.
